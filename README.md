I purchased a Keybow 2040 macro pad from Pimoroni. It was challenging to set up multiple layers for different applications, but I managed to create something close to my ideal setup. The most surprising part is that I created everything using ChatGPT's Code Copilot. I can't write code at all, and I'm not a programmer.

I was able to create multiple layers using QMK Configurator and generate a UF2 file, but I gave up halfway because I couldn't figure out how to configure the LEDs in detail. With CircuitPython, it might not be the smartest method, but I was able to customize the LED layout to my liking.

Let me explain the code for non-programmers. You can probably add as many layers as you like. Each LAYER can have 16 keys assigned, but the 4th key (top left) is set as the Fn key, so it can't be used. Pressing the Fn key switches to the next layer.

I referred to the following site for key codes: https://docs.circuitpython.org/projects/hid/en/latest/index.html It's a bit tricky to set shortcuts like Ctrl+C. You need to add them inside the for key in keys: loop.

I tried to incorporate the icons I often use in Blender and MagicaVoxel into the layers.

One issue I've encountered is that the LED blinks briefly when a key is released. Since the code was entirely generated by AI, it could probably be made smarter (but I can't program at all...).
